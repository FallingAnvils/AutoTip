# (FallingAnvils) Autotip

### Because running a command every few minutes doesn't need 70 files of source code.

A certain other, more popular, autotip mod is unnecessarily huge, requiring pings to a secret API and automatic downloads of secret, closed-source mods (!) to... retrive the list of players to be tipped? But /tipall is a thing! Oh, and *telemetry*? For a mod like this?

This mod consists of 2 source code files. Why would you need any more? At the time of writing this, the first is 28 lines long and the second is 51.

There's no configuration, no special command, just tipping every 15 minutes. What more could you want?
